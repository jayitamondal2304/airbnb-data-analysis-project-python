- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
    - 🐼 **Pandas:** Data cleaning and manipulation  
    - 🔢 **NumPy:** Mathematical operations  
    - 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization  

## 🔥 **Project Structure**
The project was divided into three main parts:  
1. **Check Missing Values:** Identified and handled missing data to ensure data consistency.  
2. **Remove Duplicates:** Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries.  
3. **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations based on client requirements.  

## 📈 **Key Insights and Findings**

### 1. **Distribution of Listing Prices**
- The **histogram** shows a fairly even distribution of listing prices across different price ranges.  
- The **KDE line** highlights the even spread, confirming that the dataset contains listings with a wide variety of prices.  

### 2. **Room Type Distribution**
- The most preferred room type is:  
    - 🏠 **Entire home/apt** → Highest popularity  
    - 🚪 **Private room** → Second most preferred  
    - 🛏️ **Shared room** → Less preferred  
    - 🏨 **Hotel room** → Least common  

### 3. **Listings by Neighborhood**
- The majority of listings are concentrated in:  
    1. **Manhattan** → Highest number of listings  
    2. **Brooklyn**  
    3. **Queens**  
    4. **Bronx**  
    5. **Staten Island** → Fewest listings  

### 4. **Price vs. Room Type**

    - **Private rooms**, **entire homes**, and **shared rooms** range between **$360 and $900**.  
    - **Hotel rooms** range slightly higher, between **$400 and $920**.

- From **2019 to 2024**, reviews increased **exponentially**, indicating growing customer engagement and platform popularity.  

## 📊 **Visualizations**
The project includes various visualizations such as:  
- **Histograms** for price distribution  
- **Bar charts** for room type and neighborhood distribution  
- **Line plots** to analyze review trends over time
